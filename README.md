# Image-Recognition
This is an Image Recognition system based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), designed to distinguish between two different images like Cats and Dogs.
During the Training period, It has a max Accuracy of 85.2% for the Dataset consisting of images of Cats and Dogs.
Also at last I tried it with random images of Dog and Cat from the internet and it answered correctly.
